# BokkyPooBahs Red-Black Binary Search Tree Library

Status: **Work in progress. Documenting before getting further testing and review - don't use yet**

A gas-efficient Solidity library using the iterative (rather than recursive) Red-Black binary search tree algorithm to help you maintain a sorted `uint` key index for your data. Insertions, deletions and searches are in **O(log n)** time (and ~gas). Note that the key of 0 is prohibited. Use the sorted keys as indices to your mapping tables of data to access your data in sorted order.

Inserting a key into an empty tree costs 68,459 gas. Inserting a key into a tree with 9,999 keys costs 127,210 gas on average. Removing an element from a tree with a single key costs 44,835 gas. Removing a key from a tree with 10,000 keys cost 81,486 gas on average.

An important use-case for this library is to maintain a sorted on-chain order book in decentralised exchange smart contracts, providing a provably fair order matching algorithm.

## Overview

### Binary Search Tree

The [Red-Black Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) binary search tree is a self-rebalancing [binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree). Following is a diagram of a fairly well-balanced binary search tree.

<kbd><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Binary_search_tree.svg" /></kbd>

The following unbalanced binary search tree was generated by inserting the numbers 1 to 32 in sequential order `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]`:

<kbd><img src="docs/RedBlackTree1To32SequentialNoRebalance.png" /></kbd>

Inserting the keys into the binary search tree in sequential order will result in this unbalanced tree resembling a linked-list.

<br />

### Red-Black Binary Search Tree

The red-black algorithm maintains a red or black colouring for each node in the tree, and uses this information to maintain a reasonably balanced tree. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree):

> In addition to the requirements imposed on a binary search tree the following must be satisfied by a red–black tree:
>
> * Each node is either red or black.
> * The root is black. This rule is sometimes omitted. Since the root can always be changed from red to black, but not necessarily vice versa, this rule has little effect on analysis.
> * All leaves (NIL) are black.
> * If a node is red, then both its children are black.
> * Every path from a given node to any of its descendant NIL nodes contains the same number of black nodes.

When an element is inserted into or removed from a red-black tree, the binary search tree is rebalanced to satisfy the red-black rules.

From Wikipedia's [Red-Black Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree) page, the following Red-Black tree was created by inserting the items `[13,8,17,11,15,22,25,27,1,6]`:

<kbd><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Red-black_tree_example.svg" /></kbd>

<br />

### Red-Black Tree With Random Insertion

The following fairly well-balanced red-black tree was generated by inserting the numbers 1 to 32 in random order `[15,14,20,3,7,10,11,16,18,2,4,5,8,19,1,9,12,6,17,13]`:

<kbd><img src="docs/RedBlackTree1To32Random.png" /></kbd>

The root node of the tree is 18, `k` represents the key numbers, `p` the parent, `l` the left node, `r` the right node. Nodes with `l0 r0` are the leaves of the tree.

<br />

### Red-Black Tree With Sequential Insertion

The following red-black tree was generated by inserting the numbers 1 to 32 in sequential order `[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32]`:

<kbd><img src="docs/RedBlackTree1To32Sequential.png" /></kbd>

A property of the red-black tree is that the path from the root to the farthest leaf is no more than twice as long as the path from the root to the nearest leaf. The shortest path has all black nodes and the longest path alternate between red and black nodes.

The shortest path is 4 levels deep: (8 black), (4 black), (1 black), (2 black).

The longest path is 8 levels deep: (8 black), (16 red), (20 black), (24 red), (28 black), (30 red), (31 black), (32 red). This is no more than twice as long as the shortest path.

## History

## Deployment

This library has been designed to be automatically compiled into your Ethereum Solidity contract or library, instead of having to deploy this library and then linking your contract or library to this library.

## Functions

See [contracts/TestBokkyPooBahsRedBlackTree.sol](contracts/TestBokkyPooBahsRedBlackTree.sol) (or the [flattened](flattened/TestBokkyPooBahsRedBlackTree_flattened.sol) version) for an example contract that uses this library.

Notes:

* The function parameter `Tree storage self` has been omitted in the documentation below, as Solidity automatically injects the library data structure in place of this first parameter
* There is a constant `SENTINEL` that is set to 0 in the library source code by default

<br />

### init

```javascript
function init() internal
```

Call this function from your contract constructor to initialises some data. Note that this is really only necessary when `SENTINEL` is non-0.

## Algorithm

The main Red-Black binary search tree algorithm is listed in [Algorithms for Red Black Tree Operations
(from CLRS text)](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~aaw/Sotirios/RedBlackTreeAlgorithm.html).

Note that this algorithm is designed to work with memory pointers to the node data. The rebalancing process after the removal of an item from the tree may result in a swapping of data values between nodes.


 As the nodes are stored as elements in a Solidity *mapping* data structure, [Iterative Algorithm for Red-Black Tree](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11328289) provides an alternative algorithm to perform this swapping. In particular, the function `RB-Delete` in the main Red-Black algorithm will need the line `then key[z] := key[y]` replaced with the alternative swapping algorithm.

<br />

<hr />

## Testing

* [x] Test random insertions and deletions of 1, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 keys
* [x] Test the insert function, including inserting a duplicate key
* [x] Test the `remove` function, including removing a non-existent key
* [x] Test the `view` functions, including what happens when a non-existent key is passed
* [x] Test sequential insertions
* [ ] Test repeated random insertions and deletions
